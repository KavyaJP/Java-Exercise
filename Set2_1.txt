Que : What will be the result of the following expression : float a = 7/4 * 9/2
Ans : here 7, 4, 9 and 2 are all int literals so all operation between them will give a int value
      / and * have both same precedence
      so the associativity would be left to right
         7/4 = 1 
      => 1*9/2
      => 9/2
      => 4
      and 4 in float is 4.0
